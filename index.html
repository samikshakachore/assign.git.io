	<p class="x"><strong><em>The series sequence in order are:</em></strong></p> <br>
	<div class="col-md-1"><strong>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)</strong><br><p>The biggest complaint about Chamber of Secrets is that it’s just so long. With a runtime just under three hours, you’ll need to pop more than one bucket of popcorn to make it through the whole thing.


	Long movies aren’t necessarily bad, but this one is unnecessarily drawn out. The issue is how the writers attempted to capture even the most minor details of the corresponding book on screen. The most integral moments in the film are when Harry gets ahold of Voldemort’s diary and destroys a Horcrux. Other than that, it’s not too important to rewatch over and over.Long movies aren’t necessarily bad, but this one is unnecessarily drawn out.

	<div class="col-md-2"><strong>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)</strong><br><p>The very first film will always hold a place in our hearts as it’s the one that started it all. It may be the oldest movie, but there’s something so heartwarming about watching the characters arrive at Hogwart’s and hearing Hagrid deliver his famous line, “You’re a wizard, Harry!”

Its hard to beat going back to the beginning and reliving those magical first moments all over again.</p></div> 
	
	<div class="col-md-3"><strong>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)</strong><br><p>CinemaBlend credits this film’s success with the brilliant editing by Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuaron. Rather than trying to capture every scene from the book, Cuaron focuses on the most important storylines that directly involve Harry, and the result is a tautly told story that will captivate audiences from start to finish.</p></div>
	
	
	<div class="col-md-4"><strong>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)</strong><br><p>Doing justice to the Triwizard Tournament was no easy task, but this film manages to pull it off beautifully. Like Prisoner of Azkaban, this installment leaves out plenty of details from the book, but that doesn’t detract from the story in any way.</p></div> 
	
	
	<div class="col-md-5"><strong>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)</strong><br><p>This film is a real turning point in the series for a few reasons. First, it’s considered the film where the main characters grew up both physically and emotionally. The storyline revolves around people not believing in Voldemort’s return, among other things.</p>

It also features Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as the headmaster and her performance is simply breathtaking. Between that and the new director, David Yates, this movie marks a whole new world for Harry Potter.</div> 
	
	<div class="col-md-6"><strong>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009) </strong><br>
	<p>This is the critical point where we lose the beloved Albus Dumbledore, but there can always be beauty in the pain. Besides that difficult death, the movie also highlights the students going through puberty and the complicated emotions associated with those changes.</p></div> 
	
	
	<div class="col-md-7"><strong>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2010/2011.)</strong><br><p>The final book was split into two films either to tell the story more fully or for Warner Brothers to make more money on the conclusion of the series—or perhaps a bit of both.
	
	For as abrupt as the first half is, the second half is that much better. This stunning conclusion for the series includes thrills around every corner and a most memorable finale that moved more than a few people to tears (no spoilers).

		All good things must come to an end, and when it came to Harry Potter, this was a fitting end that did justice to every single character. This is one movie you’ll want to re-watch over and over again</p> </div>
