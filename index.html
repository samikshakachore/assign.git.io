                <p>CinemaBlend credits this film’s success with the brilliant editing by Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuaron. Rather than trying to capture every scene from the book, Cuaron focuses on the most important storylines that directly involve Harry, and the result is a tautly told story that will captivate audiences from start to finish.

                    Doing justice to the Triwizard Tournament was no easy task, but this film manages to pull it off beautifully. Like Prisoner of Azkaban, this installment leaves out plenty of details from the book, but that doesn’t detract from the story in any way.

                    This film is a real turning point in the series for a few reasons. First, it’s considered the film where the main characters grew up both physically and emotionally. The storyline revolves around people not believing in Voldemort’s return, among other things.
